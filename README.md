## :rocket: Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-search-graphql.git
   cd book-search-graphql
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client && npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root and add:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/booksearch
